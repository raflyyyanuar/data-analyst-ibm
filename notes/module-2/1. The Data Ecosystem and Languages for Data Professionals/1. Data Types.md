# Understanding Data Types

## What is Data?
- **Data** is unorganized information that, when processed, becomes meaningful.
- It can comprise facts, observations, perceptions, numbers, characters, symbols, and images, which can be interpreted to derive meaning.

## Types of Data (By Structure):
1. **Structured Data**  
2. **Semi-structured Data**  
3. **Unstructured Data**

---

### 1. Structured Data:
- **Definition**: Data with a well-defined structure, adheres to a specified data model, and can be stored in well-defined schemas like databases.
- **Examples**: 
  - SQL Databases
  - Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) systems
  - Spreadsheets (Excel, Google Sheets)
  - Online forms
  - Sensors (GPS, RFID tags)
  - Network and web server logs
- **Characteristics**:
  - Can be represented in tabular format (rows and columns)
  - Easily analyzed with standard data analysis tools
  - Typically stored in relational or SQL databases

---

### 2. Semi-structured Data:
- **Definition**: Data that has some organizational properties but lacks a fixed schema.
- **Examples**: 
  - Emails
  - XML and other markup languages
  - Binary executables
  - TCP/IP packets
  - Zipped files
  - Integration of data from different sources
- **Characteristics**:
  - Cannot be stored as rows and columns
  - Contains tags, elements, or metadata to group and organize data hierarchically
  - XML and JSON are commonly used for storing and exchanging semi-structured data

---

### 3. Unstructured Data:
- **Definition**: Data without an identifiable structure, not suitable for relational databases (rows and columns).
- **Examples**: 
  - Web pages
  - Social media feeds
  - Images (JPEG, GIF, PNG)
  - Video and audio files
  - Documents (Word, PDF)
  - PowerPoint presentations
  - Media logs
  - Surveys
- **Characteristics**:
  - Does not follow any specific format, sequence, or rules
  - Can be stored in files and documents for manual analysis or in NoSQL databases

---

## Summary:
- **Structured data**: Well-organized, stored in databases, easily analyzed with standard tools.
- **Semi-structured data**: Somewhat organized, relies on meta tags for grouping and hierarchy.
- **Unstructured data**: Not organized in rows and columns, requires alternative storage and analysis methods.
