# Understanding Big Data

In this digital world, everyone leaves a trace. From our travel habits to our workouts and entertainment, the increasing number of internet-connected devices we interact with daily record vast amounts of data about us—there's even a name for it: **Big Data**.

**Ernst and Young** defines big data as: 

> Big data refers to the dynamic, large, and disparate volumes of data being created by people, tools, and machines. It requires new, innovative, and scalable technology to collect, host, and analytically process the vast amount of data gathered in order to drive real-time business insights that relate to consumers, risk, profit, performance, productivity management, and enhanced shareholder value.

There is no single definition of big data, but certain elements are common across various definitions, known as the V's of big data:

## The V's of Big Data

- **Velocity**: The speed at which data accumulates. Data is generated extremely fast in a continuous process. Near or real-time streaming, local, and cloud-based technologies can process information very quickly.

- **Volume**: The scale of the data or the increase in the amount of data stored. Drivers include the rise in data sources, higher resolution sensors, and scalable infrastructure.

- **Variety**: The diversity of the data. Structured data fits neatly into rows and columns in relational databases, while unstructured data is not organized in a predefined way, like tweets, blog posts, pictures, numbers, and videos. Variety also reflects that data comes from different sources—machines, people, and processes, both internal and external to organizations. Drivers include mobile technologies, social media, wearable technologies, geo technologies, video, and many more.

- **Veracity**: The quality and origin of data and its conformity to facts and accuracy. Attributes include consistency, completeness, integrity, and ambiguity. Drivers include cost and the need for traceability. With the large amount of data available, there's ongoing debate about data accuracy in the digital age. Is the information real or false?

- **Value**: Our ability and need to turn data into value. Value isn't just profit; it may also include medical or social benefits, as well as customer, employee, or personal satisfaction. The main reason people invest time in understanding big data is to derive value from it.

## Examples of the V's in Action

- **Velocity**: Every 60 seconds, hours of footage are uploaded to YouTube, generating data at an incredible speed. Think about how quickly data accumulates over hours, days, and years.

- **Volume**: The world population is approximately 7 billion people, with the vast majority using digital devices. Mobile phones, desktop and laptop computers, wearable devices, and so on all generate, capture, and store data—approximately 2.5 quintillion bytes every day, which is the equivalent of 10 million Blu-ray DVDs.

- **Variety**: Different types of data include text, pictures, film, sound, health data from wearable devices, and many other types of data from devices connected to the Internet of Things.

- **Veracity**: Eighty percent of data is considered unstructured, requiring methods to produce reliable and accurate insights. Data must be categorized, analyzed, and visualized.

## Tools for Big Data Analysis

Data scientists today use tools to derive insights from big data and handle the challenges posed by massive data sets. Conventional data analysis tools are often insufficient, so alternative tools leveraging distributed computing power are used, such as:

- **Apache Spark**
- **Hadoop** and its ecosystem

These tools provide ways to extract, load, analyze, and process data across distributed compute resources, offering new insights and knowledge. This allows organizations to connect with their customers better and enrich the services they offer.

So next time you strap on your smartwatch, unlock your smartphone, or track your workout, remember your data is starting a journey that might take it all the way around the world, through big data analysis, and back to you.
