# Modern Data Ecosystem

A modern data ecosystem includes a network of interconnected and continually evolving entities:

- **Data**: Available in a host of different formats, structures, and sources.
- **Enterprise Data Environment**: Where raw data is staged so it can be organized, cleaned, and optimized for use by end-users.
- **End-Users**: Such as business stakeholders, analysts, and programmers who consume data for various purposes.
- **Emerging Technologies**: Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, and Big Data, which are continually reshaping the data ecosystem and the possibilities it offers.
- **Roles in the Ecosystem**: Data Engineers, Data Analysts, Data Scientists, Business Analysts, and Business Intelligence Analysts all play a vital role in deriving insights and business results from data.

## Four Primary Types of Data Analysis

1. **Descriptive Analytics**: Helps decode “What happened.”
2. **Diagnostic Analytics**: Helps us understand “Why it happened.”
3. **Predictive Analytics**: Analyzes historical data and trends to suggest “What will happen next.”
4. **Prescriptive Analytics**: Prescribes “What should be done next.”

## Data Analysis Process

1. **Understanding the Problem**: Developing an understanding of the problem and the desired outcome.
2. **Setting Metrics**: Setting a clear metric for evaluating outcomes.
3. **Data Management**: Gathering, cleaning, analyzing, and mining data to interpret results.
4. **Communicating Findings**: Presenting the findings in ways that impact decision-making.
