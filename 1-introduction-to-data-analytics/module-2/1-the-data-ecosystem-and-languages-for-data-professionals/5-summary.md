# Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you have learned the following information:

## Data Analyst Ecosystem

A data analyst ecosystem includes the infrastructure, software, tools, frameworks, and processes used to:

- **Gather**
- **Clean**
- **Analyze**
- **Mine**
- **Visualize data**

## Types of Data

Based on how well-defined the structure of the data is, data can be categorized as:

- **Structured Data**: Data that is well organized in formats that can be stored in databases.
- **Semi-Structured Data**: Data that is partially organized and partially free form.
- **Unstructured Data**: Data that cannot be organized conventionally into rows and columns.

## Data Formats

Data comes in a wide-ranging variety of file formats, such as:

- **Delimited text files**
- **Spreadsheets**
- **XML**
- **PDF**
- **JSON**

Each format has its own list of benefits and limitations of use.

## Data Sources

Data is extracted from multiple sources, including:

- **Relational and non-relational databases**
- **APIs**
- **Web services**
- **Data streams**
- **Social platforms**
- **Sensor devices**

## Data Repository

Once the data is identified and gathered from different sources, it needs to be staged in a data repository so that it can be prepared for analysis. The type, format, and sources of data influence the type of data repository that can be used.

## Languages for Data Professionals

Data professionals need a host of languages to help them extract, prepare, and analyze data. These can be classified as:

- **Querying Languages**: Such as SQL, used for accessing and manipulating data from databases.
- **Programming Languages**: Such as Python, R, and Java, for developing applications and controlling application behavior.
- **Shell and Scripting Languages**: Such as Unix/Linux Shell and PowerShell, for automating repetitive operational tasks.
