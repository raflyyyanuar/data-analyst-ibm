# Lesson Summary: Data Mining

## What is Data Mining?
- **Data Mining**: The process of extracting knowledge from data, involving pattern recognition, statistical analysis, and mathematical techniques.
- **Goal**: Identify correlations, find patterns, understand trends, and predict probabilities.

## Key Concepts in Data Mining
- **Pattern Recognition**: Discovering regularities or commonalities in data.
  - Example: Analyzing login data to uncover user habits (e.g., most common login times or frequent activities).
  
- **Trends**: General tendencies of data to change over time.
  - Example: Global warming is a long-term trend despite short-term fluctuations.

## Applications of Data Mining
- **Customer Profiling**: Targeting campaigns based on behaviors, needs, and income.
- **Fraud Detection**: Identifying unusual patterns in transactions.
- **Healthcare**: Predicting health conditions and prioritizing treatment.
- **Education**: Predicting student performance to offer timely support.
- **Law Enforcement**: Deploying police in areas with a high likelihood of crime.
- **Supply Chain**: Aligning logistics with demand forecasts.

## Common Data Mining Techniques

1. **Classification**:
   - Classifies attributes into target categories.
   - Example: Classifying customers as low, medium, or high spenders.

2. **Clustering**:
   - Groups data into clusters to treat them as groups.
   - Example: Grouping customers based on geographic regions.

3. **Anomaly/Outlier Detection**:
   - Finds patterns that are abnormal or unexpected.
   - Example: Detecting spikes in credit card usage that could signal fraud.

4. **Association Rule Mining**:
   - Establishes relationships between two data events.
   - Example: Purchasing a laptop is often associated with buying a cooling pad.

5. **Sequential Patterns**:
   - Tracks events that occur in a sequence.
   - Example: Analyzing a customerâ€™s shopping journey from login to logout.

6. **Affinity Grouping**:
   - Discovers co-occurrence relationships between data points.
   - Example: Recommending products in online stores based on purchase history.

7. **Decision Trees**:
   - Builds classification models as a tree structure with branches representing probable outcomes.
   - Helps understand the relationship between input and output variables.

8. **Regression**:
   - Identifies the relationship between two variables (causal or correlational).
   - Example: Predicting house prices based on location and area.
