# Data Analytics vs. Data Analysis

The terms **Data Analysis** and **Data Analytics** are often used interchangeably, including in this course. However, it's important to note that there is a subtle difference between these terms and their meanings.

## Dictionary Meanings

- **Analysis**: Detailed examination of the elements or structure of something.
- **Analytics**: Systematic computational analysis of data or statistics.

**Analysis** can be done without numbers or data, such as in business analysis or psychoanalysis. On the other hand, **Analytics**, even without the prefix "Data," almost invariably implies the use of data for numerical manipulation and inference.

Some experts suggest that Data Analysis is based on inferences from historical data, while Data Analytics is used for predicting future performance. However, the design team of this course does not subscribe to this view, as you will see later in the course with terms like predictive analytics and prescriptive analytics.

In this course, we take a more liberal view and use the terms Data Analysis and Data Analytics to mean the same thing. For example, an earlier video is titled *Defining Data Analysis*, whereas the preceding video with the viewpoints of several data professionals is titled *What is Data Analytics*. The difference in these titles is not intentional.
