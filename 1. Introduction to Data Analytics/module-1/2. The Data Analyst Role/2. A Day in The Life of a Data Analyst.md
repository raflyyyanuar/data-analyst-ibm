# A Day in the Life of a Data Analyst

A day in the life of a Data Analyst can involve a range of tasks — from acquiring data from various sources to creating queries, foraging through data for insights, creating reports and dashboards, and interacting with stakeholders to gather information and present findings. A significant part of the job is cleaning and preparing data to ensure that findings are credible. If I were to describe one type of day, it would be one where I’m foraging through data looking for insights. This is the part of the job that I find truly fascinating.

## Example: Analyzing Billing Complaints

Hi, I’m Sivaram Jaladi. I work as a Data Analyst with Fluentgrid, a smart grid technology solutions company based in Vishakhapatnam, India. Fluentgrid is an IBM partner and has received IBM Beacon awards for its solutions in the smart energy and smart city industry segments. We offer integrated operations center solutions for power utilities and smart cities through our actionable intelligence platform, Fluentgrid Actilligence.

### The Problem

Our client, a power utility company in South India, has noticed a spike in complaints regarding overbilling. The frequency of these complaints suggests there might be a deeper issue rather than random occurrences. I was tasked with examining the complaints and billing data to identify any underlying problems.

### The Process

1. **Initial Preparation**:
   - **Identify Data Sources**: Complaint data, subscriber information data, and billing data.
   - **Formulate Initial Hypotheses**:
     - **Usage Patterns**: Is there a consumption range where overbilling occurs more frequently?
     - **Area-Wise Concentration**: Are complaints concentrated in specific localities?
     - **Repeat Complaints**: Are the same subscribers reporting overbilling repeatedly? Is there a pattern to these repeat occurrences?

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - **Billing Data**: Analyze average annual, quarterly, and monthly billing amounts of complainants to identify patterns.
   - **Location Data**: Examine if complaints are linked to specific zip codes. Found a concentration of complaints in certain areas.
   - **Date of Connection**: Over 95% of complainants had been subscribers for more than seven years. However, not all long-term subscribers experienced the issue.

3. **Deeper Investigation**:
   - **Meter Information**: Checked the make and serial number of the meters. Found that the serial numbers belonged to the same batch from the same supplier. The complaints were concentrated in areas where these meters were installed.

### Conclusion

I felt confident presenting these findings to stakeholders. I also shared the data sources and my analytical process, which adds credibility to the findings. This could either conclude the project or prompt further investigation if similar complaints arise with different commonalities or new issues.

This example illustrates the analytical process and how data insights are used to solve real-world problems.
