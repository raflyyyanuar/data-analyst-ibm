# Data Analysis Process

Data analysis involves the following steps:

- **Gathering** data
- **Cleaning** data
- **Analyzing** and **mining** data
- **Interpreting** results
- **Reporting** the findings

Through data analysis, we identify patterns and correlations between different data points. These insights help businesses understand past performance and inform future decisions, saving time and resources while ensuring greater success.

## Types of Data Analysis

### Descriptive Analytics
**Descriptive Analytics** answers the question: **What happened?** It summarizes past data and presents the findings to stakeholders, providing essential insights into past events. For example:
- Tracking past performance based on key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Analyzing cash flow

### Diagnostic Analytics
**Diagnostic Analytics** answers the question: **Why did it happen?** It takes insights from descriptive analytics and digs deeper to find the causes behind outcomes. For example:
- Investigating a sudden change in website traffic without an obvious cause
- Analyzing an increase in sales in a region without changes in marketing

### Predictive Analytics
**Predictive Analytics** answers the question: **What will happen next?** It uses historical data and trends to forecast future outcomes. Note that predictions are probabilistic, not definitive. Applications include:
- Risk assessment
- Sales forecasts

### Prescriptive Analytics
**Prescriptive Analytics** answers the question: **What should be done about it?** It analyzes past decisions and events to estimate the likelihood of different outcomes and decide on a course of action. Examples include:
- Self-driving cars making decisions about speed, lane changes, and routes
- Airlines adjusting ticket prices based on demand, gas prices, weather, and traffic

## Key Steps in the Data Analysis Process

1. **Understanding the Problem and Desired Result**
   - Define the problem and the desired outcome clearly before starting the analysis.

2. **Setting a Clear Metric**
   - Decide what will be measured and how. For example, the number of product X sold in a region during a quarter.

3. **Gathering Data**
   - Identify the required data, data sources, and tools for collection.

4. **Cleaning Data**
   - Fix quality issues in the data to ensure accuracy. This includes handling missing or incomplete values, outliers, and standardizing data from multiple sources.

5. **Analyzing and Mining Data**
   - Extract and analyze data from different perspectives to understand trends, identify correlations, and find patterns.

6. **Interpreting Results**
   - Evaluate if the analysis is defendable against objections and if there are limitations or conditions under which the analysis may not hold true.

7. **Presenting Findings**
   - Communicate and present findings in clear and impactful ways using reports, dashboards, charts, graphs, maps, or case studies.

The ultimate goal of data analysis is to impact decision-making, making effective communication and presentation of findings crucial parts of the process.
