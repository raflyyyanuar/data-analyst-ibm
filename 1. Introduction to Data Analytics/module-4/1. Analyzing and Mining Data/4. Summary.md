## **Statistical Analysis**
- **Purpose**: To use statistical methods to understand what data represents.
- **Types**:
  - **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizes data with measures such as:
    - **Central Tendency**: Mean, Median, Mode
    - **Dispersion**: Variance, Standard Deviation, Range
    - **Skewness**: Symmetry of data distribution
  - **Inferential Statistics**: Makes generalizations about data with measures such as:
    - **Hypothesis Testing**: Tests effectiveness or relationships
    - **Confidence Intervals**: Range where the population value likely falls
    - **Regression Analysis**: Examines relationships between variables
