## Standard File Formats

Some of the common file formats we will cover include:
- **Delimited text file formats**
- **Microsoft Excel Open XML Spreadsheet (XLSX)**
- **Extensible Markup Language (XML)**
- **Portable Document Format (PDF)**
- **JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)**

### 1. Delimited Text Files
- **Definition**: Text files that store data in rows where each value is separated by a delimiter (a sequence of one or more characters that mark the boundary between values).
- **Common Delimiters**: Comma, tab, colon, vertical bar, and space.
- **Examples**: 
  - **CSV** (Comma-Separated Values) – uses a comma as the delimiter.
  - **TSV** (Tab-Separated Values) – uses a tab as the delimiter.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Each row represents a record, with the first row often serving as the column header.
  - Allows field values of any length.
  - Can handle different types of data in each column (e.g., date, string, integer).
  - Widely supported by applications for data processing.

### 2. Microsoft Excel Open XML Spreadsheet (XLSX)
- **Definition**: An XML-based file format created by Microsoft for spreadsheets.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Organized into multiple worksheets, each containing rows and columns (cells).
  - Cells can store various types of data.
  - Uses an open file format, making it accessible to most applications.
  - Known for being secure, as it cannot save malicious code.

### 3. Extensible Markup Language (XML)
- **Definition**: A markup language with rules for encoding data in a format readable by both humans and machines.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Platform-independent and programming language-independent.
  - Used primarily for sharing data over the internet.
  - Unlike HTML, XML does not use predefined tags, allowing for flexible data structuring.

### 4. Portable Document Format (PDF)
- **Definition**: A file format developed by Adobe for presenting documents consistently across different platforms and devices.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Frequently used for legal and financial documents.
  - Can be used for interactive forms.
  - Preserves document formatting regardless of device or software.

### 5. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
- **Definition**: A text-based, language-independent format used to transmit structured data over the web.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Easy to use and compatible with a wide range of browsers.
  - Supports data of any size and type, including audio and video.
  - Widely used in APIs and web services for data exchange.
